    <h2>Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</h2>
    <p>The Snake Plant, also known as Sansevieria or Mother-in-law's Tongue, is a popular indoor plant choice. It has long, upright leaves that are usually green with yellow variegation, resembling the patterns on a snake's skin.</p>
    <p>Snake Plants are known for their ability to purify the air by removing toxins and releasing oxygen. They are also low-maintenance and can tolerate low light conditions, making them ideal for indoor spaces.</p>
    <p>In addition to their air-purifying properties, Snake Plants can add a touch of elegance to your room with their architectural form. They are versatile and can be placed on the floor, on a tabletop, or in hanging baskets.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that Snake Plants are toxic to pets if ingested, so it's best to keep them out of reach of cats and dogs.</p>
